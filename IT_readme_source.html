		As a participant in a course, you may have the following questions:</br>
		<br>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Why is this learning material in the course, it doesn’t relate to what I do?</em>
		<br>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>When doing an assessment, I didn’t learn about this in the learning material. Why am I being asked this?</em></br>
		<br>Learning resources and assessments are provided in your course to meet the Australian Quality Training Framework (AQTF) national set of standards. This framework applies to secondary school, Vocational Education and Training (VET), and to Higher Education studies.</br>
		<br>One of the requirements in the AQTF is that the training package which your course relates to must involve industry discussion to identify what the industry requires. From this discussion, a Unit of Competency is developed which contains ‘Elements’ and ‘Performance Criteria’ that provide broad requirements of the skills and knowledge the industry requires. This is assessed against ‘Performance Evidence’ and ‘Knowledge Evidence’ to ensure that a participant can demonstrate the knowledge and skills required.</br>
		<br>In your course Upskilled provide a range of learning resources that are selected to help develop the skills and knowledge that the AQTF and the industry requires for the qualification that you are studying. These resources are often provided based on a person having minimal or no knowledge, so it may seem very large and daunting.&nbsp; However, if you find that you know some of the learning, you can skip it and move onto something else.</br>
		<br>The learning resources may relate directly to only one unit of competency, or to several units of competency, or build up knowledge over the course – the second and last options are called clustered learning. With clustered learning, you develop some skills and knowledge immediately and are assessed on them at that point of learning, whereas other skills and knowledge will be developed and assessed throughout the course. Clustered learning has the advantage of allowing participants to build the bigger picture of knowledge and understanding over the course, and reinforces knowledge and learning at several points in the course.</br>
		<br><em>How does this fit in with my written assessments?</em></br>
		<br>You may find that some questions in an assessment do not appear to directly relate to the learning material. The type of question asked will be similar to that you will get in the industry, and require you to connect different pieces of learning together to identify the answer. So, although you may not directly have covered the question, the learning will have been there and you need to connect the pieces.</br>
		<br>As a good learning habit, we suggest you review any written assessment instructions and the assessment rubric, before commencing the learning material. This will then set your mind to focus on the knowledge that is required in the assessment.</br>
		<br>Learning resources and assessments are provided to enable participants to have a qualification that meets both the AQTF standards, and addresses industry needs.</br>
		<br>Should you have any questions relating to your course please contact your trainer, or Upskilled on 1300 009 924.
